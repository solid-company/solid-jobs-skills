# jobs-evaluate

Judge how well a cached offer fits the user's profile, give a graded verdict, and save it.

## Inputs

1. The offer — fetch it from the cache by key. The offer must have been seen by a prior search; if not, run `/jobs-search` first.
2. The profile — `sjctl profile show --json` (the default profile, or pass `--profile <name>`).

Resolve `sjctl` in this order: (1) on `PATH`, (2) `~/.solid-jobs-skills/bin/sjctl[.exe]`, (3) `./sjctl[.exe]` in the repo. If none exist, install it and use the printed path:
- macOS/Linux: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid-company/solid-jobs-skills/v0.2.0/scripts/install-sjctl.sh | bash`
- Windows: `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid-company/solid-jobs-skills/v0.2.0/scripts/install-sjctl.ps1 | iex`
- Dev fallback (Go, inside repo): `go run ./cmd/sjctl`

## Rubric

Score these six dimensions, each A (excellent) to F (disqualifying), then weight into one overall grade:

| Dimension | Weight | What to check |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Skill match | 30% | Required skills vs the profile's strong/working skills |
| Salary fit | 25% | Offer band vs the profile's minimum and target |
| Seniority fit | 15% | Offer experience level vs profile seniority |
| Work mode / location | 15% | remote/hybrid/onsite and city vs profile preference |
| Contract type | 10% | B2B vs employment vs profile preference |
| Red flags | 5% | Vague description, unrealistic scope, missing salary, deal-breakers hit |

Hard rule: if a profile **deal-breaker** is violated (e.g. below minimum salary, onsite when remote-only), cap the overall grade at D regardless of other dimensions.

Grade scale: A = apply now, B = strong, C = worth a look, D = weak, F = skip.

## Persisting

Save the verdict so it shows up in the tracker and any future dashboard:

```
sjctl evaluate save <offerKey> \
  --grade B \
  --rationale "Strong Go match; salary at target; hybrid vs preferred remote." \
  --dimensions '{"skillMatch":"A","salaryFit":"B","seniorityFit":"A","workMode":"C","contractType":"B","redFlags":"A"}'
```

## Output to the user

Lead with the overall grade and a one-line verdict, then the per-dimension breakdown and the single biggest risk. If grade ≥ B, suggest tracking it (`/jobs-track`).
